# Demographic Data Analyzer

This is my **FreeCodeCamp Python project** where I analyzed demographic data using **Pandas**. The dataset is extracted from the **1994 Census database** and contains information such as age, workclass, education, occupation, race, sex, hours worked per week, and salary.

## Project Overview

The project answers the following questions:

1. How many people of each race are represented in the dataset.
2. Average age of men.
3. Percentage of people who have a Bachelor's degree.
4. Percentage of people with advanced education (Bachelors, Masters, Doctorate) earning more than 50K.
5. Percentage of people without advanced education earning more than 50K.
6. Minimum number of hours a person works per week.
7. Percentage of people working minimum hours who earn more than 50K.
8. Country with the highest percentage of people earning >50K and the corresponding percentage.
9. Most popular occupation for those earning >50K in India.

The project uses **Pandas** to manipulate and analyze the dataset efficiently.
